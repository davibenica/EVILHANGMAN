# Evil Hangman in C

## Introduction

Welcome to the Evil Hangman game! Unlike traditional hangman games, this version makes it as difficult as possible for the player to win. Instead of choosing a word at the beginning, the game postpones the decision of the actual word, reducing the player's chances of guessing correctly.

## Prerequisites

- A C compiler like `gcc`
- Basic understanding of terminal operations

## How to play

1. You will be asked to specify the length of the word you want to guess.
2. You will then start guessing letters one by one.
3. Unlike the traditional hangman, the word may change behind the scenes to   maximize your chance of losing.
4. Keep guessing until you've either guessed the word or exhausted all your attempts!
